 <H2 id="version">Version information</H2>

 Version information is available to determine if the loaded library version
 matches the required version and to detect if certain features are supported
 In general matching major version numbers makes sure all functions
 are supported in the expected way. Different minor version numbers could
 indicated bug fix releases or very minor functionality updates.

 <pre class="v10" id="aaxGetMajorVersion">unsigned aaxGetMajorVersion()</pre>
 Return the major version number of the API this library supports.

 <pre class="v10" id="aaxGetMinorVersion">unsigned aaxGetMinorVersion()</pre>
 Return the minor version number of the API this library supports.

 <pre class="v10" id="aaxGetPatchVersion">unsigned int aaxGetPatchLevel()</pre>
 Return the patch level of the installed library.<br>
 The patch level will always be increased with every new release so it is a
 valid option to test for the patch level to be greater than a known good value.
 
 <pre class="v10" id="aaxGetVersionString">const char* aaxGetVersionString(aaxConfig config)</pre>
 <ul>
  <li> The config parameter is the handle as returned by aaxDriverOpen.<br>
       The config parameter may be set to NULL, in which case the minimum
       available configuration (AeonWave-Lite) is used.
  </ul>
 Return version information about the library as a string constant.

 <H2 id="generic">Generic</H2>

 <pre class="v31" id="aaxPlaySoundLogo">int aaxPlaySoundLogo(const char *devname)</pre>
 Plays the official AeonWave sound logo at the device specified by devname.<br>
 The function will block until playback is finished which takes about 12 seconds.<p>
 The function will return AAX_FALSE in case of an error and the appropriate error number will be set.<br>
 Otherwise AAX_TRUE will be returned.

 <pre class="v12" id="aaxFree">void aaxFree(void *region)</pre>
 Frees a memory block that was allocated by the library.<br>
 Calling this function to free a block of memory is required when the main
 application is compiled using a different compiler than the AeonWave library.
 In this case freeing a memory region might (and probably will) result in a
 segmentation fault. It is therefore recommended to use this function to free
 all memory that was allocated by AAX for instance after calling
 <a href="aax_buffer_config.html#aaxBufferGetData">aaxBufferGetData</a>.

 <pre class="v22" id="aaxGetBitsPerSample">unsigned aaxGetBitsPerSample(enum aaxFormat format)</pre>
 <ul>
 <li> format is an enumerated type <a href="aax_aaxformat.html">aaxFormat</a>.
 </ul><p>
 Return the number of bits per sample associated with a format.

 <pre class="v10" id="aaxGetBytesPerSample">unsigned aaxGetBytesPerSample(enum aaxFormat format)</pre>
 <ul>
 <li> format is an enumerated type <a href="aax_aaxformat.html">aaxFormat</a>.
 </ul><p>
 Return the number of bytes per sample associated with a format.

 <H2 id="filters">Filters & Effects</H2>
 <pre  id="aaxIsFilterSupported">int aaxIsFilterSupported(aaxConfig config, const char *filter)</pre>
  <pre  id="aaxIsEffectSupported">int aaxIsEffectSupported(aaxConfig config, const char *effect)</pre>
 <ul>
  <li> The config parameter is the handle as returned by aaxDriverOpen.
  <li> The config parameter may be set to NULL, in which case the minimum
       available configuration (AeonWave-Lite) is used.
  <li> As of AeonWave version 2.6 filters and effects can have a version number appended to the string name.<br>
       The filter or effect name string parameter may include the version number for this test, but it is not necessary.<br>
       If the version number is specified exactly the function returns only AAX_TRUE if it matches exactly.<br>
       If the version number is provided only partially then AAX_TRUE is returned if the available filter or effect version has the same major version.<br>
       If no version information is provided to test for the function returns AAX_TRUE if the filter or effect is available in any version.

   <h2>Reverb Effect</h2>

   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverberation" target="_blank">Reverberation or Reverb</a> is an effect that uses a large number of delayed copies of the original signal to give an impression of the surrounding environment. As a result the audio signal will remain present after it was produced, sometimes for a long period of time.
   <p></p>
   Rooms with furniture, carpet and curtains reflect lower frequencies but tend to absorb higher frequencies more quickly while empty rooms with concrete surfaces reflect the full frequency spectrum.
   <p></p>
   The initial delay between the direct path of the sound and the arrival of the first reflections give a good first indication of the size of the room.<br>
   Set the Delay Depth parameters to low for small rooms and high for large rooms.
   <p></p>
   Set the Decay Level parameter high for highly reflective rooms and set a low decay level to dampen the reflections rather quickly. Set it to zero to only process the first order reflections.
   <p></p>
   Set the Decay Depth parameter low for a small room and set high for a large industrial complex or a stadium.<br>
   Very high values for the Decay Depth parameter are perceived as echo.
   <p></p>
   AeonWave version 3.1 (and version 1.1 of the reverb effect) adds the option to add reverb to audio frames to support indoor sound propagation but only with a limited decay depth of 210 ms. This enables simulations up to large rooms. All reflections beyond that will simply be ignored.
   <p></p>
   AeonWave version 3.1 adds support for <a href="occlusion.html">occlusion</a> by defining a 3D obstruction (or 3D cavity) at the same position, and with the same orientation, as the audio-frame. The obstruction/cavity could influence the gain of the emitter based on the relative position of the emitter, the audio-frame(s) and listener.
   <p></p>
   AeonWave does not define the units of measurement for size, the calculations are scale invariant.
   Developers have to make sure that all distances and sizes used by AeonWave use the same unit.
   <p></p>
   Reverb is supported by the Scenery and by Audio-Frames.<br>
   Occlusion is only supported by Audio-frames.

   <h5>Reverb parameters</h5>
   The effect uses one or two effect slots.

     </dl>
     <dl>Slot 1
      <dt class="v31"><div>p0</div> AAX_OBJECT_WIDTH</dt>
      <dd>The width of the occlusion object. The width is specified in the x-direction.</dd>
      <dt class="v31"><div>p1</div> AAX_OBJECT_HEIGHT</dt>
      <dd>The height of the occlusion object. The height is specified in the y-direction.</dd>
      <dt class="v31"><div>p2</div> AAX_OBJECT_DEPTH</dt>
      <dd>The depth of the occlusion object. The depth is specified in the z-direction.</dd>
      <dt class="v31"><div>p3</div> AAX_OBJECT_DENSITY_FACTOR</dt>
      <dd>The density of the occlusion object.<br>
          Between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 means silence when the object is directly between the emitter and sensor.</dd>
     </dl>
    </dd>
   </dl>

  <h5>Reverb state options</h5>
  Specify AAX_TRUE to enable reverb or AAX_FALSE to disable it.<br>
  For occlusion it is required to set the state to AAX_TRUE (the dimensions define an obstruction) or AAX_INVERSE (the dimensions define a hole).

 <p>&nbsp;<p>

 The AeonWave class supports code to playback one audio stream in the background
 which will keep playing until it runs out of data or gets explicitly stopped.
 <p>
 There are support functions to detect whether the stream is still playing and
 to get the number of seconds the stream has been playing. If the playback
 function gets called while a stream is still playing then the previous stream
 is stopped automatically and a new stream is started.

 <pre>

   aeonwave::AeonWave aax(AAX_MODE_WRITE_STEREO);
   aax.set(AAX_INITIALIZED);
   aax.set(AAX_PLAYING);

   aax.playback("http://streamnl.atinet.nl:8004/;stream.mp3");
   do
   {
      sleep(1);
      if (key_pressed()) aax.stop();
   }
   while (aax.playing());

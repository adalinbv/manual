   <h2>Occlusion</h2>
   <p>
   Occlusion is a method to alter the sound properties based on the relative
   position of the emitter, the sensor and all audio-frames that separate them
   and have occlusion defined.
   </p>
   <p>
   Occlusion will use ray-tracing techniques to trace back the sound path from
   the emitter all the way back to the sensor. When the emitter is registered
   at an audio-frame which is registered at another audio-frame which is
   registered at a third audio-frame which is registered at the mixer
   then AeonWave makes sure that none of the audio frames block the sound path.
   And if it is blocked it will alter the sound properties accordingly.
   If one, or more, of the audio-frames between the emitter and the sensor
   does not define occlusion it will simply be skipped in the test.
   </p>
   <p>
   Occlusion will gradually adjust the gain from unaltered when the obstruction
   is not blocking the sound path from the emitter to the sensor, to
   (1.0 - density) when the obstruction is directly between the emitter
   and the sensor. Occlusion will also change the frequency response of the
   emitter if the obstruction is partly blocking the path from the emitter to
   the sensor.
   </p>
   <p>
   Occlusion will affect the overall gain when defined for the volume-filter
   and will affect the gain of the direct path when defined for the
   reverb-effect.
   </p>

      Normal occlusion defines an obstruction in 3D space<br>
      which could block the path of the sound from the emitter<br>
      the sensor when it is positioned between them.<br>
      This can be used to simulate objects that block the sound like a statue
      or a door.<br>
      By altering the density factor a closing door could be simulated.

      Inverse occlusion defines a cavity in 3D space<br>
      which does not affect  the path of the sound from the emitter<br>

   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   If two defined occlusion objects overlap they are regarded as a possible
   sound path. If two adjacent occlusion objects do not intersect they are 
   regarded as individual objects which could block the sound path.
   <p>
   Consider the following scene (<a href="images/indoor.mp3">audio example</a>):<br> F1 is registered to the Mixer, F2 is
   registered to F1, F3 is registerd to F2, E1 and F4 are registered to F3,
   F5 is registered to F4 and E2 is registered to F5
   </p>
   <p>
   F1, F3 and F5 are declared AAX_INVERSE and represent different rooms.<br>
   If either de Sensor or an Emitter is outside the defined dimensions the
   occlusion will test true and the sound is inaudible.<br>
   </p>
   <p>
   F2 and F4 are defined AAX_TRUE however and their dimensions both overlap with
   the room they want to unlock and with the Hallway.
   </p>
   <p>
   Now if the density of F2 is set to (much) less than 1.0, which simulates 
   a (partly) open door, it allows the sound of E1 to pass through F2 and
   subsequently to the Sensor.
   </p>
   <p>
    Because the audio-frames are defined indoor the sound will now come from
    the direction of F2 instead of directly from E1 or E2.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is up to the developer to make sure the path from the emitter to the
    sensor is always along the desired tree of audio-frames.

   <h2>Pitch Effect</h2>

   Adjusting the pitch of an audio-frame or mixer object with multiple registered emitters using the pitch effect will affect the pitch of all registered emitters. The effect makes it possible to let the library clamp the pitch to a maximum value. 
   <p></p>
   The hard maximum pitch-limit is 2.0 and cannot be altered.
   <p></p>
   Starting with AeonWave 3.6 (pitch-effect version 1.01) it is possible to define a starting pitch value and the amount of pitch-change per second to make the effect glide towards the value specified by AAX_PITCH automatically.
   <p></p>
   The Pitch effect is supported by the Mixer, Emitters and Audio-Frames.

   <h5>Pitch Effect parameters</h5>
   The effect uses only one effect slot.

      <dd>Maximum pitch value, anything higher will be saturated.<br>
          Between 0.0 and 2.0, defaults to 2.0</dd>
      <dt class="v36"><div>p2</div> AAX_PITCH_START</dt>
      <dd> Starting value of the pitch-glide.<br>
           The end value will be the value defined by AAX_PITCH.<br>
           Between 0.0 and 2.0, defaults to 1.0</dd>
      <dt class="v36"><div>p3</div> AAX_PITCH_RATE</dt>
      <dd> Pitch-change per second. If set to 0.5 the glide will take half a second.<br>
           The pitch will glide from AAX_PITCH_START to AAX_PITCH at AAX_PITCH_RATE.<br>
           When AAX_PITCH is reached it will remain at that value.<br>
           A positive value, defaults to 0.0 (disabled).</dd>
     </dl>
    </dd>
   </dl>

   <h5>Pitch Effect state options</h5>
   The effect is always enabled.<br>
   To enable pitch-gliding it is required to set the state to true or AAX_TIMED_TRANSITION after setting the pitch-glide parameters.<br>
   Adding AAX_ENVELOPE_FOLLOW to the state will make the pitch-glide logarithmic.

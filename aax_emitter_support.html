    <ul>
    <li> The emitter parameter is the handle as returned by aaxEmitterCreate.
    </ul><p>
   Return the actual playing time in seconds since the emitter started playback or false in case of an error.<p>
   Reasons for failure are an incorrect or already destroyed handle.<p>

   <pre class="shared" id="aaxEmitterGetBufferByPos">const aaxBuffer aaxEmitterGetBufferByPos(const aaxEmitter emitter, unsigned int pos,
                                           int copy)</pre>
   <ul>
    <li> The emitter parameter is the handle as returned by aaxEmitterCreate. 
    <li> The pos parameter defines which buffer number to return from the buffer queue.
    <li> The copy parameter defines if a buffer should be copied or just referenced.<br>
         A copied buffer needs to be destroyed by aaxBufferDestroy but a referenced buffer may become invalid when the last reference to it has been destroyed.
   </ul><p>
   Return the buffer at the requested position in the buffer stack if successful or NULL otherwise. The buffer will not be removed from the queue.<p>
   Reasons for failure are an incorrect or already destroyed handle or an incorrect position parameter.

   <pre class="shared" id="aaxEmitterGetNoBuffers">unsigned int aaxEmitterGetNoBuffers(const aaxEmitter emitter, enum aaxState state)</pre>
    <ul>
    <li> The emitter parameter is the handle as returned by aaxEmitterCreate.
    <li> The state parameter is an enumerated type <a href="aax_aaxstate.html">aaxState</a> that describes which type of buffer to get information for.
   </ul><p>
    Return the number of buffers currently in the buffer stack.

   <h5>Supported values for the state parameter</h5>
   <dl>
   <dt class="v20" id="AAX_PLAYING"> AAX_PLAYING </dt>
   <dd> Return the number of buffers that still need to play until the buffer stack of the emitter is processed. </dd>
    <dt class="v20" id="AAX_PROCESSED"> AAX_PROCESSED </dt>
    <dd> Return the number of buffers that have been processed during playback of an emitter.<br>
         Since these buffers are already processed this number of buffers can be safely removed. </dd>
    <dt class="v20" id="AAX_MAXIMUM"> AAX_MAXIMUM </dt>
    <dd> Return the total number of buffers in the buffer stack of the emitter. </dd>

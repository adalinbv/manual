   <h2>Distance Filter</h2>
   The Distance filter attenuates the emitters volume based on the distance between the Sensor and the Emitter.
   <p></p>
   AeonWave does not define the units of measurement for distances, the calculations are scale invariant.<br>
   Developers have to make sure that all distances used by AeonWave use the same unit.
   <p></p>
   If the Distance filter is applied to the Scenery all Emitters that get registered afterwards, and which do not have their own Distance filter applied, will use this setting as a default. It is always possible to set an Emitter specific Distance filter later on.
   <p></p>
   Version 1.01 of the Distance filter adds frequency response filtering based on the distance of the emitter.
   <p></p>
   Version 1.02 of the Distance filter (AeonWave version 3.4) adds support for the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/17426.html" target="_blank">ISO9613-1</a> specified distance attenuation model which can be fine tuned by specifying the slot-1 parameters. Perfectly acceptable defaults will be used when omitted.
   Calculating ISO9613-1 distance attenuation is quite involved and is done every time one of the parameters of slot-1 changes. It is therefore advised to update these parameters at a lower rate than the frame-rate.
   <p></p>
   The Distance filter is supported by The Scenery, Emitters and Audio-Frames.

   <h5>Distance Filter parameters</h5>
   The filter uses only one filter slot.

  <p>
   <br>
   Ambient sounds can be created by combining the directional and distance filter.
   <br>
   AAX_REF_DISTANCE defines the radius of the inner ambient area where the audio level stays the same and AAX_MAX_DISTANCE the maximum distance from the source location where the sound still can be heard.

   <h2>Convolution Effect</h2>

   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_reverb" target="_blank">Convolution</a> is an effect that uses an impulse response recording to give a close representation of the recorded environment.
   <p></p>
   This is a resource heavy effect, use with care.
   <p></p>
   The effect has two distinct audio paths which get mixed in the end:
   <ul>
   <li> A convoluted path which represents the room response of the original signal.</li>
   <li> A direct path of the original signal which can be filtered using the frequency filter.
   </ul>
   By filtering the direct path it is possible to simulate an object or objects
   standing between the emitter and the listener.
   <p></p>
   There are several ways to decrease resource usage for this effect:
   <ul>
   <li> Use short impulse response files.<br>
        Since it is possible to combine convolution with the reverb effect it
        would be an option to increase reverberation decay times by combining
        both effects.</li>
   <li> Increase the threshold-level.<br>
        Silence is handled efficiently by the effect so by increasing the
        silence threshold a longer impulse response file can be handled more
        efficiently. Setting the level too high might introduce artefacts
        though.
   <li> Decrease the mixer frequency.<br>
        The mixer frequency influences how many samples need to be processed
        for every refresh period. Setting the mixer frequency to 22050Hz from
        48000Hz for lower end machines will more than half the number of
        samples that need to be processed.
   </ul>
   <p></p>
   Always make sure test this effect with all used impulse response files on
   the lowest supported hardware for your project.
   <p></p>
   The Convolution effect is supported by Mixer.<br>

   <h5>Convolution parameters</h5>
   The effect uses only one effect slot.

  <h5>Convolution state options</h5>
  Specify AAX_TRUE to enable convolution or AAX_FALSE to disable it.

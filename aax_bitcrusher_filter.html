   <h2>BitCrusher Filter</h2>

   The BitCrusher filter can be used to simulate communications line degradation. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcrusher" target="_bank">BitCrusher</a> is a lo-fi (low fidelity) digital audio filter, which produces a distortion by the reduction of the resolution or bandwidth of digital audio data.
   <p></p>
   AeonWave only implements resolution-reduction using this filter. But since the frequency filter is applied before the bitcrusher filter it is easy to add bandwidth too.
   <p></p>
   AeonWave does however add the option to mix with a noise signal. And since the filter is applied after the frequency filter the noise is unaffected by any frequency filter settings.
   <p></p>
   If the combined Offset parameter and Depth parameter exceeds 1.0 then the depth of the low frequency oscillator is automatically clamped.
   <p></p>
   AeonWave 3.7.2 (version 1.01 of the filter) adds support for a timed-transition of the filter strength.
   <p></p>
   AeonWave 3.8.2 (version 1.02 of the effect) adds support for randomness.

   <p></p>
   The BitCrusher filter is supported by Emitters, Audio-Frames and the Mixer.

   <h5>BitCrusher Filter parameters</h5>
   The filter uses only one filter slot.

   <h5>BitCrusher Filter state options</h5>
   Specify a waveform type or envelope-following to enable the dynamic filter or AAX_FALSE to disable it.<br>
   Timed-transition is a one time action from a start value to an end
value which takes (1/lfo-frequency) seconds to complete.<br>
   Envelope following calculates the current amplitude and sets the value based on that with an update speed of (1/lfo-frequency) seconds. A low value for lfo-frequency therefore means it takes longer for the envelope following to reach the next value.

   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion#Audio_distortion" target="_blank">Audio Distortion</a> is a way to add harmonics or overtones to an input signal by amplification of the signal beyond the capabilities of the equipment which causes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_%28audio%29" target="_blank">clipping</a>.<br>
   As a result a sound may sound richer but too much distortion may sound unpleasant.
   <p></p>
   AeonWave lets you select from hard-clipping, with sharp signal edges and lots of harmonics, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_sound#Soft_clipping" target="_blank">soft-clipping</a>, with rounded signal edges and less and mostly uneven harmonics, and anything in between.
   <p></p>
   AeonWave also lets you select between symmetric distortion, which happens in transistor based amplifiers, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_sound#Harmonic_content_and_distortion" target="_blank">asymmetric distortion</a>, which happens in certain valve based amplifiers.
   <p></p>
   As a result distortion ranges from hard-clipping Fuzz to Valve-like Overdrive by altering just a few parameters.
   <p></p>
   The effect is auto gain-adjusting which means there is no need to alter the signal-level to compensate the different settings.
   <p></p>
   AeonWave 3.7.2 (version 1.01 of the effect) adds support for a timed-transition of the effect strength.

   <p></p>
   The Distortion effect is supported by the Mixer, Emitters and Audio-Frames.

   <h5>Distortion Effect parameters</h5>
   The effect uses only one effect slot.

      <dd>A factor defining the amount of distortion.<br>
          Between 0.0 and 4.0<br>
          0.0 equals to no distortion, 1.0 is overdrive (+22dB amplification). 4.0 is full distortion (+86dB amplification).

      <dd>A factor defining the amount of hard clipping.<br>
          Between 0.0 and 1.0<br>
          0.0 equals to soft clipping, 1.0 is hard clipping.</dd>

      <dd>A factor defining the mix between the distorted and clean signal.<br>

          1.0 equals to only the distorted signal. </dd>
      <dt class="v22"><div>p3</div> AAX_ASYMMETRY</dt>
      <dd>Specifies the amount of asymmetric distortion.<br>
          Between 0.0 and 1.0<br>
          0.0 equals to symmetric, 1.0 equals to asymmetric distortion.</dd>
     </dl>

   <h5>Distortion Effect state options</h5>
   Specify AAX_TRUE or envelope-following to enable the distortion effect or AAX_FALSE to disable it.<br>
   Timed-transition is a one time action from full to no effect strength (or from no to full strength in inverted mode) which takes 1 second to complete.<br>
   Envelope following calculates the current amplitude and sets the effect strength based on that with an update speed of 1 second.
   <ul>
   <li>AAX_ENVELOPE_FOLLOW will provide strong distortion for loud signal peaks and virtually no distortion for soft sections.
   <li> AAX_INVERSE_ENVELOPE_FOLLOW will provide strong distortion for soft sections and virtually no distortion for loud signal peaks.
   </ul>

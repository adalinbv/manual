  <H1 id="mixer">Introduction</H1>
  AeonWave is a low-level, hardware accelerated 4D spatialised audio library
  aimed at the professional simulation market. The software currently runs on
  Windows and Linux for ARM and x86 and tests have shown that AeonWave
  renders 3D audio considerably faster than competing products.
  <p>
  AeonWave started out as project Anaconda; a fast rendering new OpenAL
  implementation. After realizing this would not be good enough for
  spatialised 3D audio demands the library has been rewritten;
  <p>
  For project Barracuda the OpenAL code has been separated as thin layer on top
  of a new library which was named AeonWave Audio eXtensions library (AeonWave
  or AAX for short).
  <p>
  For the next step the internals of AeonWave were completely rewritten to be
  able to support filters, effects and sub-mixing capabilities resulting  in
  AeonWave version 2.0 or project Cheetah. While working on the transformation
  the Application Programming Interface has also been reduced and cleaned up
  considerably and function defines have been added for easy porting to the
  new API.
  <p>
  In addition to this the function inputs have been hardened; improper input
  values should not effect the integrity of the software whenever possible.
  For instance when calling a functions floating point NaN values will be
  ignored and the calling software will be notified by returning a NULL-pointer
  or false.
  <p>
  The library has been using matrices for positioning and orientation
  from the start which makes it fast and accurate without the possibility of
  glitches or temporary misalignment. Support functions are included to
  simplify matrix manipulation but it is also possible to provide a user 
  defined matrix.
  <p>
  Several hardware backends are supported by the library and built-in support
  for improved Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTF) and virtualisation
  (multiple speaker output) is available.
  <p>
  For project Devil Ray, released late 2017, AeonWave version 3.0 switched to
  dual licensing with GPL3 and a commercial license. Another big change is 
  switching to 64-bit double precision matrices internally. Further changes are
  supplemental C++ support classes, tighter integration of audio
  file and stream support code and the option to assign filters and effects to
  the sensor, emitter and audio-frames by using XML-encoded AAXS buffer objects
  which may be located at a remote host. This version also
  removed all leftovers from the version 1.0 API, fixed the return values of a
  few effect and filter functions to be more consistent with the rest of the
  API.
  <p>
  The AeonWave Audio eXtensions library defines a number of basic objects:

        A mixer is in essence pure stereo (multi-channel) and applied Filters and Effects affects the sound output.</td>

        Since buffers are static objects it is not a problem to share a single buffer amongst multiple emitters.</td>

Audio-frames can move around with a user defined position, orientation and velocity. As a result all registered emitters, sensors and audio-frames also change position and orientation with just one update call.<br>
          Audio-frames also act as a stereo sub-mixer.

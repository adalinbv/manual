   <h2>Chorus Effect</h2>
 
   The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorus_effect" target="_blanK">Chorus effect</a> adds a delayed copy of the original signal to the undelayed signal.<br>
   This gives a fuller sound an is perceived as two versions of the same sound being played simultaneously.
   <p></p>
   Only one delay effect can be used at an object (mixer, emitter, audio-frame) at any given time: either Phasing, Chorus, Flanging or Delay.
   <p></p>
   In addition to following a continuous Low Frequency Oscillator level for effect strength it is also possible to alter the strength of the effect by following the level of the input signal. This makes it possible to have a strong effect for high input signal levels and no effect for low input levels or vice versa.
   <p></p>
   If the combined Offset parameter and Depth parameter exceeds 1.0 then the depth of the low frequency oscillator is automatically clamped. 
   <p></p>
   Starting with AeonWave version 3.6 (version 1.1 of the effect) the code supports feedback and a frequency filter to be applied to the delayed signal before mixing it with the original. Feedback is used for adding flanging to the signal before mixing with the delayed signal.
   <p></p>
   AeonWave 3.7.2 (version 1.11 of the effect) adds support for a timed-transition of the effect strength.
   <p></p>
   AeonWave 3.8.2 (version 1.12 of the effect) adds support for randomness.
   <p></p>
   The Chorus effect is supported by the Mixer, Emitters and Audio-Frames.

   <h5>Chorus Effect parameters</h5>
   The effect uses only one effect slot.

   <h5>Chorus Effect state options</h5>
   Specify a waveform type or envelope-following to enable the chorus effect or AAX_FALSE to disable it.<br>
   Timed-transition is a one time action from a start value to an end
value which takes (1/lfo-frequency) seconds to complete.<br>
   Envelope following calculates the current amplitude and sets the value based on that with an update speed of (1/lfo-frequency) seconds. A low value for lfo-frequency therefore means it takes longer for the envelope following to reach the next value.<br>
